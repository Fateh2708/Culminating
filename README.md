This game is a two-player pong-like game where each player controls a paddle to bounce a ball back and forth, aiming to score points by making the ball pass the opponent's paddle. The ball starts in the middle of the canvas and moves in a diagonal direction, bouncing off the top and bottom edges of the canvas. Players can move their paddles up and down using designated keys to intercept the ball. When the ball hits a paddle, it reverses direction, and the player earns points. The game also features an upgrade system where players can spend their earned points to increase their paddle height or movement speed, adding a strategic element to the gameplay. The game is won when one player reaches a score of 5, prompting a victory message and the option to restart. The straightforward yet engaging mechanics make it a fun and competitive experience.
